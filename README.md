# 🧑‍💻 My First Web Portfolio (HTML Only)

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my very first web project built with just **HTML** — no CSS, no JavaScript, just pure structure! This is part of my learning journey to become a Web Developer.

- 🔗 Links to my social media
- 🖼️ Profile picture
- 🌐 SEO-friendly meta tags
- 📸 Open Graph tags (so it looks nice when shared)
- ⭐ Favicon to make it look professional!
